# Covid Management System 


## Project Description
In this project we designed an information system for managing the status of Corona patients , This project is realized as REST service technology.
This system allows working with API that delivers some endpoints (explained in chart below) supports Swagger API(json file in main directory).
The system allows you to add new patients that are positive for Corona virus , all information or inputs and outputs delivered in json format.
With this system you will be able to add patients routes and add encounter patients that might be sick , The user can add lab tests and the system will automatically move sick patients for waiting list for interview. 
This system can show statistics on the patients status , amount of confirmed patients , amount of healed patients and amount of isolated patients In addition it calculates the number of patients per city.
